# Collatz-Conjecture-Algorithm
Collatz Conjecture Algorithm:  An integer n, such that n > 1, is to be divided by 2 if it is even. If n is odd then it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added. Such steps are repeated until 1 is obtained.   Problem: Find the number of steps it takes for any integer that is greater than 1 to reach 1 following the Collatz Conjecture Algorithm.
